This project is to support the study group exercises for the DC area JBoss User Group (dc-jbug). 
Our study group meets weekly on Thursday evenings to prepare for Red Hat's JBoss Certified Developer (JBCD) in 
Persistence certification.

The JBCD - Persistence exam tests whether candidates are ready for the real-world responsibilities of creating 
and maintaining Java applications that use the Java Persistence API (JPA) with Hibernate.

The exam objectives and recommended study material is available at:

Details about all our meetings are available at http://www.meetup.com/dc-jbug.
